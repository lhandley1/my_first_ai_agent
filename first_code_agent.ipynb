        "This project is my first introduction to the world of AI agents, specifically focusing on building a code agent using the smolagents framework. So far, I have installed the necessary libraries, set up access to the Hugging Face API, created a `CodeAgent` with a specific language model, and attempted to implement and use a custom tool. The initial goal is to create a basic agent that can utilise custom tools to perform specific tasks, starting with a simple tool to get the current time. This project is a learning experience to build a foundational understanding before exploring more advanced agent capabilities.\n",
